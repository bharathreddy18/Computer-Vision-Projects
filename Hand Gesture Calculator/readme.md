# Hand Gesture Calculator

This project implements a hand gesture-based calculator using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It allows users to input numbers and operators using finger counting and hand gestures, providing a touchless and interactive calculation experience.

## Features

-   **Finger-based Digit Input:** Input digits by raising the corresponding number of fingers.
-   **Gesture-based Operator Selection:** Select mathematical operators (+, -, \*, /) with hand movements.
-   **Real-time Calculation Display:** See the calculation results instantly on the screen.
-   **Touchless Interaction:** Perform calculations without touching a physical keypad.

## Technologies Used

-   **OpenCV:** For capturing and displaying the live video feed.
-   **MediaPipe Hands:** For accurate and real-time hand tracking and finger counting.
-   **Python:** The backbone of the application's logic.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.6+
-   OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
-   MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
-   NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bharathreddy18/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
    cd Hand Gesture Calculator
    ```

2.  Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python hand_calculator.py
    ```

2.  **Digit Input:** Raise the corresponding number of fingers within the designated input boxes.
3.  **Operator Selection:** Point your index finger to the desired operator button.
4.  **Confirmation:** Show your palm with your right hand to confirm the input.
5.  **Evaluation:** Make fists with both hands to evaluate the expression.
6.  **Reset:** Press 'r' to reset the calculator.
7.  **Quit:** Press 'q' to quit.

## Code Structure

-   `hand_calculator.py`: Contains the main `HandCalculator` class and the application's logic.

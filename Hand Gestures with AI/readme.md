# Gesture-Based Math Solver & Shape Recognition using AI 🤖🖐️

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project enables users to **solve math problems** and **recognize shapes** using only **hand gestures**! By leveraging **computer vision and AI**, it provides a seamless, hands-free interaction experience.

## 🔥 Features
✅ **Hand Gesture-Based Math Solver** – Draw numbers & equations in the air, and AI will solve them instantly!  
✅ **Shape Recognition** – Sketch a shape using gestures, and AI will recognize and classify it.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Instant AI-powered results with no delay.  
✅ **Canvas Reset** – Easily clear the screen and start fresh.  

## 📌 Real-World Applications
🔹 **Education** 📚 – Interactive math learning tool for students.  
🔹 **Accessibility** ♿ – Helps individuals with disabilities interact hands-free.  
🔹 **Smart Classrooms** 🏫 – Enhances digital learning.  
🔹 **AR/VR Interactions** 🎮 – Gesture-based controls in gaming & immersive tech.  
🔹 **Creative Design** 🎨 – Artists can sketch and get AI-powered interpretations.  
🔹 **Industrial Use** 🏭 – Engineers & professionals can interact with AI-driven systems hands-free.  
🔹 **Human-Computer Interaction** 💻 – A step toward natural AI interfaces.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV & Mediapipe** – Real-time hand tracking 📷
- **Google Gemini AI** – AI-powered content generation 🤖
- **Streamlit** – Interactive UI ⚡
- **Deep Learning** – For shape recognition & equation solving 🧠

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bharathreddy18/Computer-Vision-Projects.git
   cd "Hand Gestures with AI"
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run MathWithGestures.py
   ```

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Show a specific hand gesture** to start drawing on the virtual canvas.
2. **Draw numbers or shapes in the air**, and AI will process the input.
3. **AI generates an output**, solving math problems or recognizing the drawn shape.
4. **Use a five-finger gesture** to reset the canvas and answer.
